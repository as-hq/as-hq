-- | evalChain' works in two parts. First, it goes through the list of cells passed in and
-- evaluates them. Along the way, new fat cells (created as part of a list) are created
-- that may need to get re-evaluated. These get recorded in the fourth argument (type [FatCell]),
-- and the heads of these lists get recorded in the fifth.
--
-- When we finish evaluating the original list of cells, we go through the newly created fat cells
-- and re-evaluate those. We are NOT just running eval on this list of cells directly,
-- because we don't need to re-evaluate the individual cells in the list, ONLY their descendants.
-- We also need to check for circular dependencies, which is why the pastListHeads are passed in.
-- 
-- Note that we can get into arbitrarily many cycles of alternating between normal evalChains, 
-- then evalChains where we're processing fatCells, normal evalChains, fatCell processing evalChains, 
-- etc. Note also that pastFatCellHeads accumulates across all of these, and doesn't just reflect the
-- heads of the cells passed in from the latest eval. 
--
-- finally, in the second case of evalChain', we might evaluate a Coupled expression which belong to a 
-- list head. If so, we evaluate it, but "delete" the cells in the previous list by passing the argument
-- "deletedLocs", the 6th argument. This is how shrink lists work. In DT.writeTransaction, we turn these 
-- locations into actual blank cells and delete them. 
-- 
-- #needsrefactor there's probably a more Haskell way of doing this with a state monad or something.
