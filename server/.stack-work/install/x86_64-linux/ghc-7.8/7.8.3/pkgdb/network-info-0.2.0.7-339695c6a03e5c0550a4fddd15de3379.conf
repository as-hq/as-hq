synopsis: Access the local computer's basic network configuration
description: This library provides simple read-only access to the
             local computer's networking configuration. It is
             currently capable of getting a list of all the network
             interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
             addresses.
             .
             network-info has been tested and is known to work on
             Ubuntu 10.10, FreeBSD 9.0, Mac OS X 10.6.4 and Windows
             XP/7. It probably works on other flavours of Linux,
             OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
