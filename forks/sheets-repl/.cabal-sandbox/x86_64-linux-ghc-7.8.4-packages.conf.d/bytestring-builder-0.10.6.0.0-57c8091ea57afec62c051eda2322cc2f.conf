synopsis: The new bytestring builder, packaged outside of GHC
description: This is the bytestring builder that is debuting in bytestring-0.10.4.0, which
             should be shipping with GHC 7.8, probably late in 2013.  This builder has
             several nice simplifications and improvements, and more out-of-box
             functionality than the older blaze-builder.
             .
             Note that this package detects which version of bytestring you are compiling
             against,  and if you are compiling against bytestring-0.10.4 or later, will
             be an empty package.
             .
             This package lets the new interface and implementation be used with most
             older compilers without upgrading bytestring, which can be rather
             problematic.  In conjunction with blaze-builder-0.4 or later,  which
             offers an implementation of blaze-builder in terms of bytestring-builder,
             this should let most people try the new interface and implementation without
             causing undue compatibility problems with packages that depend on
             blaze-builder.
             .
             GHC 7.6 did debut an almost identical interface and implementation, but with
             slightly different module names and organization.   Trying to re-export/rename
             the builder provided with 7.6 did not turn out to be very practical,  because
             this interface includes new functions that rely on Builder internals,
             which are not exported in 7.6.  Furthermore, these module names should be
             deprecated in 7.10.
