1. Take a server log. 
2. Paste it into "/alpha-sheets/server/client_messages"
3. In Sublime, press Ctrl+F, enter the following line (in regex mode):

(\nMessage: (ClientMessage \{clientAction = (.+?)\})\n)
then press alt + Enter

4. Copy it, clear client_messages, and paste it. Your file should now look something like: 
Message: ClientMessage {clientAction = UpdateWindow, clientPayload = PayloadW (Window {windowSheetId = "INIT_SHEET_ID", topLeft = (1,1), bottomRight = (50,50)})}

Message: ClientMessage {clientAction = Open, clientPayload = PayloadS (Sheet {sheetId = "INIT_SHEET_ID", sheetName = "Sheet1", sheetPermissions = Blacklist []})}

Message: ClientMessage {clientAction = UpdateWindow, clientPayload = PayloadW (Window {windowSheetId = "INIT_SHEET_ID", topLeft = (1,1), bottomRight = (50,50)})}


5. Ctrl H: 
Message: ClientMessage \{clientAction = (UpdateWindow|Get)(.*)(\n*)
(replace with blanks)

6. Ctrl H:
Message: ((.*?)\n)
$1\n
