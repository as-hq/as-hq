-- This is a file with settings that may be local to your development environment, e.g.,

-- We're storing this information in an environemnt file (Environment.hs), which
-- is in the .gitignore. _Environment.hs exists as a template for creating Environment.hs, 
-- for convenience (since Environment.hs is in the .gitignore)._Environment.hs is NOT
-- actually imported by any other modules, and is not in the .cabal.
