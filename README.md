To set up DB: 
1) Install libmyodbc and unixodbc-dev with apt-get
2) sudo chmod a+w+r odbc.ini in etc folder, edit config to add database, test with isql -v AlphaSheets

[AlphaSheets]
Driver       = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libmyodbc.so
Description  = MyODBC 3.51 Driver DSN

3) In MySQL as-instance, create two tables: 
	a) a_s_relations with FromLoc and ToLoc as varchar(256) 
	b) a_s_cells with Location,Expression,Value all varchar(256) where Location is a primary key



TODO: 
1) There is no need to do as many DB operations as we are in Dispatch
For example, no need to do initial setCells or dbUpdateBatch
The two getCells can be combined into one because we know getCells locs will return an array of length locs
etc.
2) Frontend bug: ranges show up as transposes
3) Figure out the lag between C cpu time and actual time
4) Optimize mysql/innodb config
